# AoC23

My horrendous, eye-bleeding solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) 2023 code jam.

## Log Book

### Day 1: Trebuchet?

Fairly easy, except that one edge case `eightwoone` that took me a while (a good night's sleep to solve)

### Day 2: Cube Conundrum

Such big input! Parsing them was a pain, but we got there eventually (Part II made me think hard)

### Day 3: Gear Ratios

Now this was something tricky, I don't know if my approach was the way to go, but needed to debug and reframe multiple times to get it right. Mainly cause the numbers messed the indexing real bad.

### Day 4: Scratchcards

The problem was all good, but the bonus stacking instructions were unclear at the beginning, once I saw the logic on reddit, it didn't take me that long. (My laptop froze a bit for Part II, prolly due to my bad code :))

### Day 5: If you give a seed a fertilizer

Too much to parse, too much logic to implement, too big numbers in input, too large numbers to crunch. Just too much wrong with this one

### Day 6: Wait for it

Fairly easy logic to wrap me mind around, was a good relief after such monster puzzles before. Also, this puzzle made me realize how stupid I am and also how small changes in code can make huge differences
